What is React?
- It's a library for building user interfaces.
- React runs on the client as a SPA(Single Page App), but can be used to build full stack apps by communicating with server via an API e.g. MERN stack.
- It's often referred to as a front-end "framework" because it's comperable to a framework such as Angular or Vue, but it's realy a library.

Why Use React?
i. Reusable components
ii. Allow structuring of your app "View" layer
iii. JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension) - Dynamic markup
iv. Interactive UIs with Virtual DOM
v. Performance and testing
vi. Very popular in the industry

UI Components
- Include a bunch of separate components i.e. Functions and classes
- Components render/return JSX and can also take in "props"

Working with State
- Components can have "state" which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves.
- "App" or "global"  state refers to state that is available to the entire UI, not jus a single component.
